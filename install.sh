#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.5.1"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.5.1:
# - FIXED: _curl_socks_fallover now passes -L (follow redirects). GitHub
#        release-asset URLs 302-redirect to objects.githubusercontent.com;
#        without -L the download body was empty ("Downloaded file is empty"),
#        so --action update-luci / --with-luci could never fetch the .ipk/.apk.
#        Harmless for non-redirecting URLs (releases API, raw.githubusercontent).
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.5.0"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.5.0:
# - ADDED: `--action update-luci` and `--with-luci` flag. Installs/updates the
#        luci-app-podkop-bot web UI: fetches the latest release asset for the
#        active package manager (opkg->.ipk, apk->.apk) from GitHub with the
#        usual direct->SOCKS fallback, then installs it DETACHED (setsid) so an
#        rpcd restart triggered by the install can't abort it. Progress is
#        written to /tmp/podkop_bot_luci_update.log (polled by the UI).
# - ADDED: after a bot install/update, the script now offers to install the
#        web UI too (interactive prompt; unattended via --with-luci). Single
#        entry point for the whole stack.
# - GUARD: update-luci fails loudly if curl is absent (bare system) instead of
#        hanging; on a router with the bot installed curl is always present.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.4.2"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.4.2:
# - Misc fixes carried from the luci-app work (log mojibake via printf
#   placeholders, /proc scan race, section-aware paths). Version bump to keep
#   the vendored copy in luci-app-podkop-bot in sync with the bot repo.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.4.1"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.4.1:
# - FIXED: _podkop_uci_pkg() mapped netshift -> "podkop" (wrong UCI namespace).
#        NetShift lives in the `netshift` namespace; detection already knew the
#        variant but the mapping dropped it. Now plus->podkop-plus,
#        netshift->netshift, *->podkop. (Same bug fixed in the rpcd backend.)
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.4.0"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.4.0:
# - FIXED: msg() ate %s/%d placeholders. Branches printed their format with
#        printf "literal-with-%s", so $(msg X) executed that printf with no
#        argument and the placeholder vanished before any caller could
#        substitute — every version/path/count in install logs came out blank
#        ("Installed: v", "Config: /etc/config/", "Downloading bot v..."). All
#        54 placeholder-bearing msg branches now emit their format verbatim via
#        printf '%s' "literal", so both single- and double-printf callsites
#        substitute correctly. Non-placeholder messages and callsites with an
#        immediate argument were left untouched.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.3.3"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.3.3:
# - FIXED: /proc cmdline scan in _bot_alive() and _reap_bot_forks() leaked
#        "can't open /proc/PID/cmdline: no such file" to stderr when a process
#        exited mid-scan (race). The redirect-open error came from the shell
#        setting up "< /proc/PID/cmdline", which the inner 2>/dev/null on tr did
#        not catch. Wrapped the read in a subshell so the redirect error is
#        suppressed too. Cosmetic (scan still works), but kept the log clean.
# - KNOWN ISSUE (not fixed here): update-flow summary prints empty version /
#        config fields ("Installed: v", "Config: /etc/config/"). Root cause is
#        the msg() helper executing printf '...%s' with no argument, which eats
#        the %s before the caller can substitute. Affects ~71 %s-bearing
#        messages; needs a dedicated pass converting those msg branches to
#        printf '%s' "literal-with-%s". Deferred to avoid a risky broad change.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.3.2"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.3.2:
# - FIXED: read-only actions (status, check, check-token) no longer acquire the
#        installer lock. check-token does a network getMe (seconds) and the
#        Wizard may call it repeatedly; locking made it hang on — or get blocked
#        by — a stale/concurrent install lock for no reason.
# - FIXED: _release_lock now only releases a lock THIS process acquired
#        (_LOCK_HELD guard). Previously the EXIT trap of a read-only action would
#        remove a lock held by a concurrent install/update — so running the
#        Wizard's token check during an install could yank that install's lock.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.3.1"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.3.1:
# - FIXED: --action check-token printed the startup banner + variant-detection
#        log BEFORE its JSON, so callers parsing the output saw non-JSON and
#        treated a valid token as installer_error. check-token now joins the
#        _QUIET_STATUS fd3 guard (like status/check): banner/log go to /dev/null
#        and only the JSON result is emitted on the restored stdout.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.3.0"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.3.0:
# - NEW: --action check-token for the LuCI Setup Wizard (TZ 9.4). Validates a
#        bot token via Telegram getMe using the same _curl_socks_fallover
#        transport as the installer (direct -> SOCKS tiers), so validation works
#        behind ISP blocks instead of a naive direct curl. Reads bot_token from
#        --config; emits a flat JSON result on fd: {valid:true,username,route} or
#        {valid:false,reason,detail} with reason in
#        empty_token|token_invalid|telegram_unreachable|network_timeout. No
#        mutation, network-only, runs before heavy init.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.2.0"
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.2.0"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.2.0:
# - NEW: Legacy init.d auto-heal on update. Bot <=0.15.1 shipped a procd-only
#        init with no stop_service and no fork cleanup; `init stop` left forked
#        children (health daemon + startup-notify poll) alive, so repeated
#        updates/respawns accumulated zombie instances (seen up to 6) fighting
#        over the Telegram API (409 Conflict / getUpdates race). The update flow
#        now: (1) reaps all live /usr/bin/podkop_bot forks BEFORE swapping the
#        binary via _reap_bot_forks (kill → wait → kill -9 → clear pidfile);
#        (2) detects a legacy init via _init_is_legacy (marker: absence of the
#        _kill_all_podkop_bot function) and force-replaces it with the canonical
#        working init via _write_working_init, backed up to .bak under the same
#        rollback umbrella as the binary.
# - NEW: _write_working_init() is now the single source of the init.d body —
#        both first-install and update call it, so the generated init can't
#        drift between flows. Carries _kill_all_podkop_bot in both start_service
#        and stop_service.
# - CHANGED: post-(re)start verification in the update flow uses _bot_alive (a
#        /proc scan) instead of `init status`, which lies on legacy scripts;
#        rollback uses _reap_bot_forks instead of `init stop`.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.1.1"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.1.1:
# - FIXED: --action status running-state detection no longer trusts
#        `/etc/init.d/podkop_bot status`. Routers running bot <=0.15.1 shipped
#        incomplete init.d scripts whose status returns 0 even when the process
#        is dead, so status reported running:true on a stopped bot (and
#        luci-app-podkop-bot then showed a green lamp on a dead bot). Liveness
#        is now read from a /proc cmdline scan for /usr/bin/podkop_bot, with the
#        init wrapper and rc.common excluded. The pidfile check remains as a
#        secondary fallback. Same detection method luci-app-podkop-bot's rpcd
#        backend now uses, keeping one source of truth across the project.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.1.0"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.1.0:
# - NEW: Offline bootstrap fallback. download_file() and download_file_optional()
#        try a vendored local copy as a final tier, after direct + SOCKS are
#        exhausted. Copies live in $VENDOR_DIR (/usr/lib/podkop_bot), matched by
#        URL basename (podkop_bot.sh→podkop_bot, podkop_bot_init→podkop_bot_init).
#        Lets the bot install where raw.githubusercontent.com is blocked and no
#        SOCKS exists yet — the primary case for an anti-censorship tool. The
#        luci-app-podkop-bot package ships these copies, making the system a
#        self-contained offline bootstrap. Pure headless run (no LuCI package) →
#        $VENDOR_DIR absent, tier skipped, behaviour identical to v2.0.0.
# - NOTE: Vendored copies reflect bot version at package build time; online
#        install/update always prefers the network copy.
#
# INSTALLER_VERSION="2.0.0"
#
# CHANGELOG v2.0.0:
# - NEW: Podkop variant auto-detection (original / evolution / netshift / plus).
#        Detected via UCI field fingerprint (action= vs connection_type=,
#        presence of Plus-only fields) plus binary/package signature. Variant
#        is shown in the pre-flight summary and used to pick the correct UCI
#        field names for SOCKS tier1 discovery.
# - NEW: _get_socks_endpoints() rewritten to support all 4 variants. Original/
#        evolution/netshift use connection_type=proxy; Plus uses action=proxy.
#        Previously only the legacy connection_type schema was checked, so
#        tier1 fallback silently returned nothing on any Plus install — the
#        installer had no transport to fall back on if GitHub was blocked
#        during a *first* install (no fallback_socks configured yet either).
# - NEW: Bilingual UI (English / Russian). Language chosen interactively at
#        startup, or via --lang en|ru / unattended config "lang". All prompts,
#        warnings and summary text are now routed through a tiny message
#        table (msg()) instead of hardcoded English strings.
# - NEW: Verbose, multi-line explanations before every interactive prompt —
#        what the setting does, why it matters, and what happens with each
#        choice — instead of a single terse question line.
# - NEW: --unattended mode with --action install|update|uninstall|status|check
#        and --config <path-to-json>. Lock file prevents concurrent runs.
#        Designed for luci-app-podkop-bot's rpcd backend to call this script
#        without any TTY interaction. See schema comment below.
# - NEW: Expanded final summary: shows detected podkop variant, podkop/sing-box
#        versions, where every file lives, and a "recommended next steps"
#        block — explains *why* Mixed Proxy matters and clarifies that YACD
#        exact LuCI paths, rather than just listing useful commands.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.9.0:
# - NEW: _get_socks_endpoints() reads tier1 (podkop mixed_proxy) and fallback_socks
#        from UCI — works before bot starts, no bot variables needed.
# - NEW: _curl_socks_fallover() wraps curl with automatic SOCKS fallover:
#        direct → tier1 → each tier2_N. Used by version check and token validation.
# - NEW: download_file() now tries SOCKS tiers after direct wget/curl fail.
#        Prints "Downloaded via socks5h://..." when proxy was used.
# - NEW: Token validation (getMe) uses _curl_socks_fallover — works behind ISP blocks.
# - NEW: Version check uses _curl_socks_fallover instead of separate wget/curl fallback.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.8.0:
# - FIXED: safe_stop_bot() now reads PID from /tmp/podkop_bot/bot.pid (new BOT_DIR
#          path since v0.14.1), with fallback to legacy /tmp/podkop_bot.pid for
#          older installs. Previously always missed the PID and relied solely on
#          killall -9 as a safety net.
# - FIXED: cleanup_bot_runtime_files() rewritten to cover both new BOT_DIR paths
#          (/tmp/podkop_bot/*) and legacy flat paths (/tmp/podkop_bot_*) so it
#          works correctly after upgrade, downgrade, or fresh install.
# - FIXED: Uninstall (option 4) now also removes /tmp/podkop_bot/ directory,
#          leaving no artifacts after complete removal.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.7.0:
# - NEW:  Option 4 — full uninstall with double confirmation (type "YES" then
#         "REMOVE"). Removes: bot binary, init.d script, /etc/config/podkop_bot
#         (token, chat_id, all settings), all /tmp runtime files.
#         podkop and sing-box are NOT touched. Useful for clean reinstall or
#         permanent removal.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.6.0:
# - FIXED: download_file() now uses --connect-timeout 10 --max-time 30 on curl
#          and -T 15 on wget. BusyBox wget hangs indefinitely without -T when
#          DNS or network is slow/broken (hit in practice on flaky WAN).
# - FIXED: cleanup_bot_runtime_files() list now includes /tmp/podkop_bot_active_section,
#          /tmp/podkop_cl_cache* and /tmp/podkop_pubip_cache.txt — all files the
#          bot creates on first run that carry section/cache state between versions.
# - FIXED: validate_socks_url() now rejects port > 65535 (was only checking
#          digit count, not value). Added awk numeric range check.
# - IMPROVED: pkg_update() failure is now a warning, not a hard die() — on some
#             routers with stale feeds the update fails but the package is already
#             installed. Installer continues with a warning instead of aborting.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.5.0:
# - NEW:  safe_stop_bot now calls cleanup_bot_runtime_files() (Step 5) which
#         removes all /tmp/podkop_bot_* IPC/state files before deploying new binary.
#         Prevents stale route keys, nudge timestamps, socks state from old versions
#         polluting the new bot startup (root cause of 'tir4' mystery).
#
# CHANGELOG v1.4.0:
# - FIXED: vv0.7.14-r1 → v0.7.14-r1: opkg returns version with leading 'v',
#          installer was adding another via "v${PODKOP_VER}". Added sed strip.
# - FIXED: Update flow now shows full summary (version, path, useful commands)
#          instead of bare "Done." + exit 0 before summary block.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.3.0:
# - NEW:  safe_stop_bot(): kill by PID file + killall -9 before binary replacement.
#         Prevents zombie watchdog subshells surviving update.
# - NEW:  podkop presence check with version display before install.
# - NEW:  admin_ids configured via uci add_list (fixes space-separated breakage).
# - NEW:  Fallback SOCKS configuration in interactive setup.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.2.0:
# - NEW:  Detect accidental HTML download (wrong GitHub blob URL) and show correct
#         raw.githubusercontent.com URL with clear error message.
# - NEW:  apk package manager support for OpenWrt 25.x+.
#
# CHANGELOG v1.1.0:
# - NEW:  Update flow: detect existing install, show token/version, offer
#         update-keep-config / reinstall / exit options.
# - NEW:  init.d script download and installation.
# - NEW:  Verbose progress output throughout.

#   1. Package name via opkg/apk (podkop-plus, podkop, etc. — name varies by
#      maintainer/fork but is the strongest signal when present).
#   2. UCI field fingerprint: Plus uses `action=` on routing sections and has
#      Plus-only fields (subscription_urls, rule_set, detect_server_country).
#      Original/evolution/netshift use the legacy `connection_type=` field.
#      Evolution and netshift are functionally close to original for our
#      purposes (same connection_type schema) — distinguished only by binary
#      path/package name when available, otherwise both fold into a single
#      "legacy schema" bucket reported as best-guess.

# The web UI is a SEPARATE package from the bot. This installs or updates it by
# fetching the latest release asset from GitHub and handing it to the system
# package manager. Two things make it non-trivial:
#   1. The asset kind depends on the package manager: opkg wants the .ipk,
#      apk (OpenWrt 24+/25+) wants the .apk.
#   2. The web UI ships the rpcd backend that may itself be driving this very
#      update. So the actual package-manager call is DETACHED (setsid/nohup) and
#      logs to a file the UI polls — if rpcd restarts mid-install, the install
#      still completes and the log survives.
